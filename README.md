## Implementation of RSA and AES-128 Encryption, and SHA-256 Hashing

Implemented algorithms in Java using RFC 8017, NIST.FIPS.197, and NIST.FIPS.180.

AES encryption is achieved using the appropriate mathematical functions without hardware acceleration, as a result it is noticeably slower than other implementations.
